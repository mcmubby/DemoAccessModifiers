This project is used to explain the public, protected and private access modifiers using a real life scenario.

In this case, I have a house. Using the house I demonstrated the level of access my sister and a stranger have to my house.

The goal is to see who can:
1. knock on my door;
2. unlock my door;
3. use my toothbrush.
